Create empty text box that takes user inputs
	Only allow box to take numberical inputs
	Limit inputs to digits 1 through 10

Create a variable for amount of user inputs
	Limit it to three
	
Create a function that generates a random number on the backend betwen 1 and 10 everytime the page is refreshed
	
Create a function that links the random number output to the the user input
	Test to see if the inputs match
	If they match print "You're Right"
	If they don't match subtract one from the user input variable
		Stop subtracting at zero at end the loop

Create text banner above the empty box with the guessing game description
	Have the text display at all times 
	Description reads "A random number will be chosen between 1 and 10. Try to guess the number. Type your guess in the box below." 

Create a dynamic banner below the empty box that changes based on if the user guess correctly or not.

	Have number of inputs count down from however many inputs are left
	If input gets subtracted, display "Wrong. Try Again. You have [variable] chances left"
